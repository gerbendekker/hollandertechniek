Although Visual Studio states that "PackageIconUrl detected but is deprecated. Use PackageIcon instead." it isn't supported yet by nuget. https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8189

"Currently, displaying the icon by using the <PackageIcon/> or <icon/> property on packages showed on NuGet in Visual Studio is not supported."

This repo is used to supply package icons for DevOps.
